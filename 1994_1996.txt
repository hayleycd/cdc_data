Caveats:
"1. About Metropolitan areas and Regions: Metropolitan area of residence at the time of diagnosis of AIDS is identified for"
"adult/adolescent patients residing in MSAs with 500,000 or more population. For adult/adolescent patients residing in an MSA"
"with less than 500,000 population, in a non-metropolitan area, or whose metropolitan area of residence is unknown, and for all"
"pediatric patients, Region of residence is identified."
"2. Only Adult/adolescent males are classified according to their sexual orientation. The variable for sexual classification has"
"just 4 categories:<br/>1) Adult/adolescent male who has sex only with other men, or sex is Missing, or sexual orientation is"
"Missing<br/>2) Adult/adolescent male who has sex with Both men and women<br/>3) Adult/adolescent heterosexual male or Pediatric"
"male<br/>4) Female (both adult/adolescent and pediatric)."
"3. Only the metropolitan areas are displayed on the maps. Although regions are not displayed on the maps, regional data are"
"included in the quantile distributions when regions are included in the data results."
"4. About unidentified risk: Adults/adolescents born, or who had sex with someone born, in a country where heterosexual"
"transmission was believed to be the predominant mode of HIV transmission (formerly classified as Pattern-II countries by the"
"World Health Organization) are no longer classified as having heterosexually acquired AIDS. Similar to case reports for other"
"persons who are reported without behavioral or transfusion risks for HIV, these reports are now classified (in the absence of"
"other risk information which would classify them into another exposure category) as 'no risk reported or identified' (see"
"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 11, 1994). Children whose mother was born, or whose mother had sex with someone"
"born, in a Pattern-II country are now classified (in the absence of other risk information which would classify them into"
"another exposure category) as 'Mother with/at risk for HIV infection: has HIV infection, risk not specified.'"
"5. About Exposure and pediatric patients (age under 13 years at diagnosis): Pediatric cases are classified in just 4 exposure"
"categories:<br/>1) Hemophilia/coagulation disorder<br/>2) Mother with, or at risk for, HIV infection<br/>3) Receipt of blood"
"transfusion, blood components, or tissue<br/>4) Risk not reported or identified."
"6. Age groups classify the patient's age at time of diagnosis. The Age groups are structured in irregular ranges, in order to"
"affect numerator size and protect confidentiality. For example, cases where age is 'Missing' are included in the age 35-39 year"
"old range."
